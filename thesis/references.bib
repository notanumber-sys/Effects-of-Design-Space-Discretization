	abstract = {Neutrino oscillation experiments presently suggest that neutrinos have a small but finite mass. If neutrinos have mass, there should be a Lorentz frame in which they can be brought to rest. This paper discusses how Wigner’s little groups can be used to distinguish between massive and massless particles. We derive a representation of the SL(2,c) group which separates out the two sets of spinors: one set is gauge dependent and the other set is gauge invariant and represents polarized neutrinos. We show that a similar calculation can be done for the Dirac equation. In the large-momentum/zero-mass limit, the Dirac spinors can be separated into large and small components. The large components are gauge invariant, while the small components are not. These small components represent spin-1/2 non-zero-mass particles. If we renormalize the large components, these gauge invariant spinors represent the polarization of neutrinos. Massive neutrinos cannot be invariant under gauge transformations.},

	abstract = {As the most advantageous total hip arthroplasty (THA) operation is the first, timely replacement of only the liner is socially and economically important because the utilization of THA is increasing as younger and more active patients are receiving implants and they are living longer. Automatic algorithms were developed to infer liner wear by estimating the separation between the acetabular cup and femoral component head given a computed tomography (CT) volume. Two series of CT volumes of a hip phantom were acquired with the femoral component head placed at 14 different positions relative to the acetabular cup. The mean and standard deviation (SD) of the diameter of the acetabular cup and femoral component head, in addition to the range of error in the expected wear values and the repeatability of all the measurements, were calculated. The algorithms resulted in a mean (±SD) for the diameter of the acetabular cup of 54.21 (±0.011) mm and for the femoral component head of 22.09 (±0.02) mm. The wear error was ±0.1 mm and the repeatability was 0.077 mm. This approach is applicable clinically as it utilizes readily available computed tomography imaging systems and requires only five minutes of human interaction.},

	doi = {10.1108/14684521211254068},
	abstract = {Purpose
              The aim of this research is to define a data model of theses and dissertations that enables data exchange with CERIF‐compatible CRIS systems and data exchange according to OAI‐PMH protocol in different metadata formats (Dublin Core, EDT‐MS, etc.).
            
            
              Design/methodology/approach
              Various systems that contain metadata about theses and dissertations are analyzed. There are different standards and protocols that enable the interoperability of those systems: CERIF standard, AOI‐PMH protocol, etc. A physical data model that enables interoperability with almost all of those systems is created using the PowerDesigner CASE tool.
            
            
              Findings
              A set of metadata about theses and dissertations that contain all the metadata required by CERIF data model, Dublin Core format, EDT‐MS format and all the metadata prescribed by the University of Novi Sad is defined. Defined metadata can be stored in the CERIF‐compatible data model based on the MARC21 format.
            
            
              Practical implications
              CRIS‐UNS is a CRIS which has been developed at the University of Novi Sad since 2008. The system is based on the proposed data model, which enables the system's interoperability with other CERIF‐compatible CRIS systems. Also, the system based on the proposed model can become a member of NDLTD.
            
            
              Social implications
              A system based on the proposed model increases the availability of theses and dissertations, and thus encourages the development of the knowledge‐based society.
            
            
              Originality/value
              A data model of theses and dissertations that enables interoperability with CERIF‐compatible CRIS systems is proposed. A software system based on the proposed model could become a member of NDLTD and exchange metadata with institutional repositories. The proposed model increases the availability of theses and dissertations.},
